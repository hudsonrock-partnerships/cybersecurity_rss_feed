<h2>What about</h2>

A simple textfile with my favourites cybersecurity rss/atom feeds which allow me to centralize all the ressources i monitor into a command line interface.

<h2>How 2</h2>


<li>First check & eventually install this wonderful rss reader called Newsboat https://github.com/newsboat/newsboat</li>

<li>Then you can drop the url file into the newsboat folder</li>

<li>Some of my feeds are not in english, feel free to propose your favorites in your own languages if the feeds are significally relevants , i'm especially interested in basque or even spannish ressources</li>
